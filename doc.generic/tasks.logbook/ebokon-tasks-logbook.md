# Introduction

This document contains some general remarks concerning the SORMAS-N field test and the daily tasks for all SORMAS roles.
Furthermore you can keep track of your work and experiences in a structured logbook every day. The booklet is concluded by a final assessment.

## Purpose of the System

SORMAS-N<sup><a id="fnr.1" name="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup> was developed for two purposes. First, to assist public health workers in *containing outbreaks of epidemic prone diseases*, where main aspects in containing the epidemic are contact tracing and outbreak management.
Second, to assist in *systematically collecting routine data* on mandatory notifiable diseases as timely and exhaustive as possible.

## Purpose of the Pilot Phase


A 6-week pilot phase will test the *usability* of SORMAS-N for those two purposes. During this phase, SORMAS-N will be tested in two Nigerian states, Oyo and Kano. In these states, smart-phones containing the SORMAS-N app will be distributed in the participating local government areas (LGAs) and the SORMAS-N desktop applications will be used at the respective state epidemiologist’s offices (see Table 3, Table 4 and Table 5).

During the pilot phase, every person participating in the SORMAS-N test will be required to carry out certain tasks and enter data daily via the smart-phone or the desktop application during the days of Monday to Friday.

As SORMAS was developed for two different purposes, these are tested in 2 different ways:

1.  *Exercise disease* &#x2013; to see how SORMAS assists in contact tracing and management of an outbreak prone disease (e.g. Ebola), participants will be provided with daily information on a mock-disease called exercise disease<sup><a id="fnr.2" name="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup>, blurred by cases of a clinically similar disease called other febrile disease<sup><a id="fnr.3" name="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3">3</a></sup>, that can reliably be distinguished from exercise disease by lab diagnosis only. This data comes from a simulated scenario and all data will be generated by a computer. It will give an impression of an outbreak with cases and contact persons as realistic as possible – but names, places and stories are invented. This invented data is to be entered according to the role (see below) each participant takes on.

2.  *Routine data collection* &#x2013; three different diseases<sup><a id="fnr.4" name="fnr.4" class="footref" href="#fn.4">4</a></sup> were chosen to test SORMAS’ usefulness in collecting routine data: Measles, Cholera and Avian Influenza<sup><a id="fnr.5" name="fnr.5" class="footref" href="#fn.5">5</a></sup>. 
    This data needs to be entered daily in SORMAS-N in addition to the paper based forms that are already in use and currently collected weekly. These are real data and depend on their appearance in the respective LGAs. They are not coming from a simulation. Therefore, every case of those 3 diseases seen in the LGAs should appear twofold: on a paper form and in SORMAS-N. The data on paper will be collected in the usual way by the DSNO. 
    
    For *Hospital focal persons* and *Surveillance officers* a difference to the current practice will be, that you will also be required to enter information daily even if there are no cases of measles, cholera and avian flu (daily zero-reporting).

## User Roles

As demonstrated in the training, during an outbreak of an epidemic prone disease, there would be an organizational framework called *Emergency Operation Center (EOC)* to manage the different surveillance and outbreak information and activities. Within this framework, people take on different roles with different preset tasks, depending on their background. This is reflected in SORMAS. Every user of SORMAS has its unique role. All roles are briefly sketched. In the following sections your role and tasks are outlined in more detail.

A *Hospital focal person* (aka *Informant*) collects information on illness and death among patients and health care workers in a health facility and enters this information into SORMAS-N.

A *Surveillance officer* collects information on *exercise disease* and the 3 selected mandatory notifiable diseases in the community. She verifies and completes information on rumors according to her investigation. She assures daily notification of all suspected and confirmed cases of Measles, Cholera, Avian Influenza occurring in the LGA. This includes daily zero-notification of these 3 diseases, if no cases have occurred.

The *Rumor officer* triages and processes incoming rumors on *exercise disease* and forwards them to the *Surveillance supervisor*.

The *Surveillance supervisor* manages and coordinates information received from the *Rumor officer* and the *Surveillance officers*. She decides on investigating a new rumor. 

A *Contact officer* is responsible for all aspects of contact tracing of contact persons. For Avian Influenza, this concerns human and animal cases. For *exercise disease* this includes daily visits of contact persons, assessing and documenting symptoms and notifying new possible cases.

The *Contact supervisor* is responsible for coordination of the contact management of *exercise disease* and Avian Influenza. She is responsible for all *Contact officers* within her state. She informs the *Case supervisor* about symptomatic contact persons and hands over suspected cases for further management, e.g. evacuation, isolation, lab confirmation, decontamination or psycho-social support.

The *Case supervisor* coordinates all activities around the case management (i.e. clinical management, isolation measures, transport, decontamination of residences or facilities, burial, psycho-social support). She immediately communicates results of laboratory investigations in case of *exercise disease* and Avian Influenza and thereby updates the status of *suspected cases* to *confirmed cases*, *probable cases*, *non-cases* or *discarded cases* resp..

## Data for Exercise Disease

This booklet gives you an overview of the daily tasks on *exercise disease* for each role. In a supplementing document individual information including all injects will be given to each participant. It will contain data that should be entered by you which have been generated by the SORMAS simulation, and are invented especially for this pilot. These guided tasks will trigger further action resulting in additional data. All these *resulting data* will then be compared with the *expected data* to provide another evaluation method. On selected weekends during the pilot phase it is planed to adjust the data to the simulated story line. 

*Entries by the users are made from Monday to Friday only. Entries by the system will be made on weekends only.*

## The Logbook

This booklet contains for each day of the pilot phase a page &#x2013; the log &#x2013; which is left for users’ comments and feedback. It is meant to document any problems or experiences that may occur. It is very important to document any difficulties or problems that occurred – this will help us to improve SORMAS.

## Help!

If you feel that the SORMAS-N manual is not sufficient to answer your questions, the *SORMAS-N helpline* is available, where the following persons (see Table 3) can assist you.
