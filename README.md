# ebokon.simulation

Simulating contacts during an outbreak and tracking them in a software system.

## Project

The simulation and generation of field test materials was part of the [Ebokon/10 Project](http://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/E/Ebola/EBOKON_Projekte_des_RKI.html) in which the [SORMAS Tool](http://www.helmholtz-hzi.de/de/forschung/forschungsschwerpunkte/bakterielle_und_virale_krankheitserreger/epidemiologie/projekte/sormas/sormas/news/) was developed.

## Main Results

- framework for agend based simulation writen in [Mathematica](http://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/)
- guidlines to extract data for enriching the abstract simulation with real life data (e.g. [OSM-Data](http://download.geofabrik.de/))
- automatic generated [booklets](doc.injects/all) for the pilot phase
- everything as reproducible research (in [org-mode](http://orgmode.org/) and [R](http://www.r-project.org/))
