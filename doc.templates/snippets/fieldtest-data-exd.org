This booklet gives you all the data for your daily tasks on /exercise disease/. The data it contains, which have been generated by the SORMAS simulation, are invented especially for this pilot. Please do not worry, if some fields are named differently in the mobile app, the desktop app or this document resp.. For example, not all symptoms in the applications match those in this booklet. You are ask to put in some grain of salt here and there (indicated by text in /italic font/). All entered facts will trigger further action by various other users and will result in additional data. These /resulting data/ will then be compared with the /expected data/ to provide another evaluation method. 
# On weekends during the pilot phase it is planed to adjust the data to the simulated story line. 

/Entries by the users are made from Monday to Friday only./
